##Subtasks

Any line beginning with a tab is considered a comment in Atea. I've taken this a step further and defined sub tasks.<br />
The sub tasks are purely cosmetic and do not affect Atea features.

###Pending subtask: 
Any comment beginning with *

###Completed subtask: 
Any comment beginning with /
