#TextMate bundle for [Atea](https://github.com/pkamenarsky/atea)

[Atea](https://github.com/pkamenarsky/atea) is a great task manager and timetracker for MacOS.<br />
In this TextMate bundle I've colorized the Atea syntax for readability.

##Subtasks

Any line beginning with a tab is considered a comment in Atea. I've taken this a step further and defined sub tasks.<br />
The sub tasks are purely cosmetic and do not affect Atea features.

###Pending subtask: 
Any comment beginning with *

###Completed subtask: 
Any comment beginning with /

##Installation

1. cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/
